/*
The manager of a football stadium wants you to write a program that calculates the
total ticket sales after each game. There are four types of ticketsâ€”box, sideline,
premium, and general admission. After each game, data is stored in a file in the
following form:
ticketPrice numberOfTicketsSold
...
Sample data are shown below:
250 5750
100 28000
50 35750
25 18750
The first line indicates that the ticket price is $250 and that 5750 tickets were sold
at that price. Output the number of tickets sold and the total sale amount. Format
your output with two decimal places.
