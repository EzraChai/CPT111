9. State whether each of the following definitions is valid or invalid. If any of them are invalid, explain the reason.

A) int ivar;                        
int *iptr = &ivar;                  valid

B) int ivar, *iptr = &ivar;         valid

C) float fvar; int *iptr = &fvar;   invalid, because an integer pointer can only point to integer variables.

D) int nums[50], *iptr = nums;      valid

E) int *iptr = &ivar;               
int ivar;                           invalid, because ivar is declare after it is being used which is wrong.
